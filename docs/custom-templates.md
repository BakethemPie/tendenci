## Custom Templates

In the Pages app on your Tendenci site, you can select a custom template to use to display your page. This is useful when constructing pages for special occasions or for creating targeted landing pages for marketing efforts.

The first step is to create the custom template. Custom templates replace the `default.html` template. Copy that template and rename it as `default-` then your custom template name, using -'s instead of spaces or underscores. An example would be `default-blue-background.html` or `default-google-landing-page.html`. Your custom template can include template code to dynamically pull in content from other apps, as well as rearranging the elements on the page or removing certain elements. Once your template file is created, add it to the theme directory as you would with other template files.

These templates will appear in the dropdown on the page add and edit screen. Select the template there, and your page will then use it instead of the normal `default.html` template.
