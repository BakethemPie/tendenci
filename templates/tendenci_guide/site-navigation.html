<p>Your site came with a standard navigation bar. As you customize your site, you may want to make changes to the <strong>Main Nav</strong> and add <strong>Sub Nav</strong> links. To do this, you will need (1) the URL of the page where you want the user to go and (2) a little bit of HTML know-how. Not much. If you are a newbie, you will catch on quick. Not to worry!</p>
<h3>First, add your pages</h3>
<p>We covered this back in the beginning. Remember the URL that was defaulted in for you? That is what we will need. Don't remember it? Go to <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Content&gt;Pages&gt;List</span></strong>. Then click on the page you want. Look at your URL. We need to grab everything immediately following your domain name.</p>
<p><img title="url.png" src="http://media.tendenciapp.com/images/tendenci_guide/url.png" alt="url.png" width="308"></p>
<p>To link to this page, you will need <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">/about-us/</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Commit it to memory, write it down or better yet, open a new tab in your browser so you can quickly reference it.</p>
<h3>Then, edit your navigation</h3>
<p>You can find the link to update your navigation in the Admin Quick Links portion of the Dashboard. (<a title="Update Navigation" href="/theme-editor/?file=/templates/nav.html" target="_blank">Click here to open the Update Navigation window.</a>)</p>

<p>Take a minute to look at this structure. It is just like an outline. The first level items are your <strong>Main Nav</strong> links. First, we reference the URL (these display in green), then we write the exact words we want to display in the navigation bar (these display in black). The <strong>Sub Nav</strong> links are in a second level list under one of your Main Nav links.</p>
<p>The easiest way to modify your nav is to copy/paste an existing line of code and then modify it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The navigation HTML above shows on your site like this:</p>
<p><img title="nav-display.png" src="http://media.tendenciapp.com/images/tendenci_guide/nav-display.png" alt="nav-display.png" width="300"></p>
<p>Tendenci also stores previous versions of your nav right below the editing box. So if you really get yourself in a mess, just revert back to an earlier version, take a deep breath, and start over!</p>
<p>Remember that the Site Navigation is the primary tool your visitors will use to quickly find things on your site. Keep it simple and well-organized!</p>
