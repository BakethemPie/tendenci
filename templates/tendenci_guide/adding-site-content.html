<p>Keeping your site content fresh is the best way to keep people coming back!</p>
<p>Content takes on many different forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pages</li>
<li>Articles and News</li>
<li>Stories</li>
<li>Events</li>
<li>Photo Albums</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding content in Tendenci is very simple. Just click the icon and go. (Or use the navigation link at the top of the screen for quick access.) Let's look at some examples.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: 5px;" title="add-page.png" src="http://media.tendenciapp.com/images/tendenci_guide/add-page.png" alt="add-page.png" width="300" height="NaN" align="left"></p>
<h3><strong>Pages</strong></h3>
<p><a title="Tendenci Help Files: Pages" href="http://tendenci.com/help-files/topic/96/" target="_blank">Pages </a>are simply that - web <em>pages </em>that live on your web <em>site</em>. Pages on your site will include things like "About Us" and "Benefits of Membership".</p>
<p>To add a page, simply click the <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Pages </span></strong>icon and click <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Add </span></strong>- or choose<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"> Content &gt; Pages &gt; Add</span></strong> from the menu along the top. (<a title="Pages Add" href="/pages/add/" target="_blank">Click here to add a page.</a>)</p>
<p>Enter a page <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Title </strong></span>and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Content</strong></span>. Note the friendly content editor that lets you format your text as if you were using a common word processing program! You can also insert images or other media files, such as video or sound clips, to add excitement to your page!</p>
<p>Note also the&nbsp;<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">URL Path</span></strong>&nbsp;that is defaulted in based on the title. You will use this to reference this page later when you are editing your site navigation.</p>
<p><em><strong>"I need a minute to figure out what to write on my page."</strong></em></p>
<p>First draft not your best work? We get that. In Tendenci, you have the option to uncheck the <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Active </span></strong>box if you are not ready for the page to be visible to the public.</p>
<p>To reaccess and edit this page in the future, click the <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Pages </span></strong>icon in the Dashboard and click <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Edit</span></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tada! You are building your site!!</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Articles and News</strong></h3>
<p>Most of the latest and greatest from your group will show up in <a title="Tendenci Help Files: Articles module" href="http://tendenci.com/help-files/topic/4/" target="_blank">Articles and News</a>. (or your Blog!)</p>

<p>When a site visitor clicks on "<a title="Articles List" href="/articles/search/" target="_blank">Read our Latest News</a>", they will see a list of your Articles or News stories. You may also display a few of the most recent Articles on the home page of your site.</p>
<h3><strong>Stories</strong></h3>
<p><a title="Tendenci Help Files: Stories module" href="http://tendenci.com/help-files/topic/92/" target="_blank">Stories</a>&nbsp;refer to articles outside of your organization that you want to highlight on your site.</p>
<p><img style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;" title="Stories-search.png" src="http://media.tendenciapp.com/images/tendenci_guide/Stories-search.png" alt="Stories-search.png" width="200" height="NaN" align="right">For example, if you see an in-industry story on another web site that would be of interest to your people, you can add a reference and photo to your site that points back to the original source. It is a great way to share links with another organization and continually provide fresh and relevant content for your users!</p>
