<h3>Add the set</h3>
<p>First, create the set.&nbsp;For example, May Luncheon or Annual Holiday Party.&nbsp;You can always uncheck the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Active </strong></span>field while you build out the set.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Content &gt; Photo Sets &gt; Add </span></strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">or&nbsp;</span><a title="Photo Sets Add" href="/photos/set/add/" target="_blank">Click here to create a photo set.</a></p>
<h3>Add the photos</h3>
<p>Then select the photos to be uploaded to that set and add titles, captions and tags!</p>

<p>After the photos have been uploaded, you can organize them in whatever order you wish and choose one for the "cover". You can also bulk edit the photo information, such as adding or changing tags for all photos.</p>
<h3>Why put photos here instead of on another photo sharing web site?</h3>
<p>Because YOU want the traffic! Instead of letting someone else host your photos, put your photos on your own site. Then you can link them to all your communications and promotions! Give access to the photo upload module to all your volunteer photographers and they can do the work! Then LINK LINK LINK!!</p>
