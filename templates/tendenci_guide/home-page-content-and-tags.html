<p>Now that you are comfortable with adding content, let's look at some ways to use that content creatively.</p>
<h3><strong>Displaying Content on the Home Page</strong></h3>
<p>The site template selected may display some of your content on the home page of your site. If you have an <strong>Events </strong>block on the home page – or maybe an <strong>Articles </strong>block – these items will automatically display as they are entered.</p>

<p>Other types of content will use <strong>Tags </strong>to determine what displays on the home page.</p>
<h3><strong>Using Tags</strong></h3>
<p>When adding content, you will often see a <strong>Tags </strong>field. <strong><a title="Tendenci Help Files: Tags" href="http://tendenci.com/help-files/topic/60/" target="_blank">Tags </a></strong>are used to pull various types of content to the Home Page of your website. In the following layout, the central image of the koala is a photo associated with a story titled Community Day at the Zoo.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img title="story-display-homepage.png" src="http://media.tendenciapp.com/images/tendenci_guide/story-display-homepage.png" alt="story-display-homepage.png" width="400" height="NaN"></p>
<p>Note the four parts to the story: <strong>image, title, summary, </strong>and <strong>link to read more</strong>. (<a title="Stories Add" href="/stories/add/" target="_blank">Click here to pull up the Add Story screen.</a>) In order to get this story to appear in the <strong>Rotator </strong>section of the site template, the word <strong>rotator</strong> is put in the <strong>Tags</strong> field for this story when adding.</p>
<p><img title="Rotator-tag.png" src="http://media.tendenciapp.com/images/tendenci_guide/Rotator-tag.png" alt="Rotator-tag.png" width="396"></p>
<p>You can designate multiple stories with the "rotator" tag and your home page will rotate through all designated stories. Most sites have 3-5 stories targeted for rotation.</p>
<p>Other sections of your template will use different tags to display the story in different places with different formatting. Look for the <strong>tag label</strong> as you roll over each portion of the page.</p>
